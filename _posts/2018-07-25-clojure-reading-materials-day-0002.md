# Day 2 of #100DaysOfClojure

As I start this journey to really learn CLojure, I realize that I will need some references to drive my learning forward. I know that there are a few really good books on Clojure out there and I want to commit to reading some of them during this time. 

I have read Living Clojure in the past and really liked it. That was a couple years ago, so I want to add that to my reading list. 

That brings my list up to three books:

* Living Clojure
* Programming Clojure
* Functional programming patterns in Scala and CLojure

I think that three books is a good number to commit to reading. I may add another along the way. Today I started in on Living Clojure and Functional Programming patterns. I also have Clojure installed on my workspace.
