title: I am loving node

Recently, I decided that I would learn node and modern JavaScript. I had considered learning JavaScript in ernest for a long time, but never got around to it. I think that this had a lot to do with being attached to the command line, automation, testing and build tools. The concept of using a web browser as a development environment, while I'll admit is pretty cool, just didn't sit well with me. 

In the past I learned Ruby, Python and dabbled in Clojure and so I have grown to appreciate things like:

* Rake, the Ruby build tool
* Pip, the Python package manager
* The elegance of functional programming in Clojure. 

Well, I got over myself and started learning modern JavaScript in Node.js and I'm really glad I did. All the tools and concepts that I want are there and I'm having fun using them.
