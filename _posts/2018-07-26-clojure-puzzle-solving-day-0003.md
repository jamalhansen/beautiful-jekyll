# Day 3 of #100DaysOfClojure

Another resource that I will be using during my 100 days of Clojure will be online learning exercizes. There are a number of sites that have kata style puzzles for praticing what you know.  These will provide a one or more tests and allow you to come up with a solution written in Clojure that passes the tests. 

Two sites offer these in a variety of languages including Clojure, these are:
* [exercism.io](https://exercism.io/tracks/clojure) - [My profile](https://exercism.io/profiles/jamalhansen)
* [codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/kata/search/clojure?q=&beta=false) - [My profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/jamalhansen)

There is also a site that is written in Clojure and offers puzzles specifically written for Clojure.

* [4Clojure.com](http://www.4clojure.com/) - [My profile](http://www.4clojure.com/user/jamalhansen)

I hope to utilize these sites in addition to [my reading]({% post_url 2018-07-25-clojure-reading-materials-day-0002 %}) over the next 100 days to practice my Clojure skills.
