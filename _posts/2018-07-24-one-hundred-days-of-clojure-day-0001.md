About fifty days ago, I comitted to the [100 days of code challenge](http://www.100daysofcode.com/). I failed. I made it to about day 35 and then I missed a day, then two, then it was a week. I feel bad about it. 

I enjoyed 100 days of code, it was a good challenge. I set out to learn more about modern JavaScript and Solidity. I did those things. I finished reading two books:

* Simplifying Javascript
* Functional Light Javascript

I started reading many more. 

It turns out that I like where Javascript has gone in the past few years. It reminded me that I wanted to get really good at a functional language. It reminded me that I [started learning Clojure a few years back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6s6knznIS4&list=PLyLTyCCJDTTeBJkHNsxgPo8-YIKWLakMm&index=1).

It's time for me to finish learning Clojure. I even bought myself a ticket to [Clojure/conj](http://2018.clojure-conj.org/) to celebrate my completion of my 100 day Clojure learning sprint. 

Here I go, 100 days of Clojure, ready?  Go!
