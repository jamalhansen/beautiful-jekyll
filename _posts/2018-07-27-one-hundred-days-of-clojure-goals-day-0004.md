# Day 4 of #100DaysOfClojure

As I embark on my 100 days of Clojure, I would like to setup some goals beyond reading and practicing.  These goals should be measureable and time-bound.  I think that the time-bound part is simple. I have a hundred days total, but I can get a little fancy and make a mid-way checkpoint

## Day 50
* Complete reading 2 of my books
* Complete the easy level puzzles on 4clojure
* Have an understanding of macros

## Day 100
* Complete reading all 3 of my books
* Complete the medium level puzzles on 4clojure
* Start an application or tool written in Clojure that is network aware
* Have 50 working tests in my application
* Try ClojureScript

This looks fairly daunting at this point, so I will stop here, but maybe I will be able to complete a stretch goal or two

## Stretch goals
* Be 5 kyu in Clojure on codewars.com
* Complete 20 exercizes in Clojure on exercism.io
* Have 100 working tests in my application
* Complete writing a functional tool in Clojure
* Be comforable with macros
* Be comfortable with ClojureScript

Challenge accepted!
